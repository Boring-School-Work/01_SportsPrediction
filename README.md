## Overview of Problem

In sports prediction, large numbers of factors including the historical performance of the teams, results of matches, and data on players, have to be accounted for to help different stakeholders understand the odds of winning or losing.

In this project, we are tasked to build a model(s) that predict a player's overall rating given the player's profile.
